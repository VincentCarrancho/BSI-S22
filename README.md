#  BSI-Revised

Hello Everyone! My name is Vincent and I was one of the Co-Leaders for the Business Software Infrastructure team in the Fall '21 season of SparkDev! There will be a few changes from the first iteration. The main two iterations are going to be the **Transition from MongoDB to Firebase** and a UI revamp. This rebuild of the initial BSI project will improve greatly on the initial one!
